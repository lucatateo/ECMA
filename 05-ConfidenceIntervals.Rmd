Consider our snow vole case study... We will calculate the confidence intervals for the mean of the weight of the individuals, for the foot length, and for different groups. 

```{r packages}
library(Rmisc)
library(Hmisc)
library(ggplot2)
library(boot)
```

```{r load-data}
dati <- read.csv("data/captures.csv", sep=";")
```


# Calculating and plotting CIs with the traditional method

The function `CI` in the `Rmisc` package produces confidence intervals for the mean using the traditional method:

```{r}
CI(dati$weight_g, ci=0.95)
```

So what?? How can we fix that??

```{r}
CI(na.omit(dati$weight_g), ci=0.95)
```

What about the CIs for different group of animals?

```{r}
dati2 <- na.omit(dati)
group.CI(weight_g ~ sex,
         data= dati2,
         ci=0.95)
intervalli <- group.CI(weight_g ~ sex,
         data= dati2,
         ci=0.95)
intervalli
```


```{r}
ggplot(intervalli, aes(x=sex, y=weight_g.mean, colour=sex)) +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=weight_g.lower, ymax=weight_g.upper), width=.1) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point()
```

Do it on your own:

* plot just one of the confidence intervals (for males or for females, of for the overall mean)
* plot the confidence intervals for the mean weights, grouped for age
* repeat for the footlength


# Calculating and plotting CIs with the bootstrapping method

We first need to apply the bootstrap to our data. For this purpose, we use the function `boot` in the `boot` package:

```{r}
boot.data <- boot(dati2$weight_g,
                  function(x,i) mean(x[i]), 
                  R=10000)
```

Now we can use the bootstrapped data to calculate the CIs, using the `boot.ci` function:

```{r}
boot.ci(boot.data,
        conf = 0.95)
```

The function generates different types of non-parametric confidence intervals. For routine use, it is recommended to use the BCa or percentile methods. The formulae on which the calculations are based can be found in Chapter 5 of Davison and Hinkley (1997). Davison, A.C. and Hinkley, D.V. (1997) Bootstrap Methods and Their Application, Chapter 5. Cambridge University Press.

Do it on your own:

* Calculate the bootstrapped intervals for the sex groups
* Plot the bootstrapped intervals
