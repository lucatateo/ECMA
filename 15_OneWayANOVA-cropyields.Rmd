# Problem
(source: Crawley, The R book)

We have an experiment in which crop yields per unit area were measured from 10 randomly selected fields on each of three soil types. All fields were sown with the same variety of seed and provided with the same fertilizer and pest control inputs.

The question is whether soil type significantly affects crop yield, and if so, to what extent.

```{r}
sand <- c(6,10,8,6,14,17,9,11,7,11)
clay <- c(17,15,3,11,14,12,12,8,10,13)
loam <- c(13,16,9,12,15,16,17,13,18,14)
dati <- data.frame(sand,clay,loam)
dati
```


# Tasks

* Calculate the mean for each soil and make a boxplot for the data
* The data format is not appropriate for subsequent analysis, prepare the data by creating a new data frame with a column for the soil type!
* One of the assumptions of ANOVA is about the homogeneity of variances - check for heteroschedasticity!
* Continue with the analysis of variance
* Graphically check for the assumptions
* Fit a linear model to the data to find out between which soil types the differences are actually significant


## Calculate the mean for each soil and make a boxplot for the data

```{r}
colMeans(dati)
boxplot(dati)
```

## Change the data format

```{r}
soil.type <- c(rep("sand",10),
               rep("clay",10),
               rep("loam",10))
yields <- c(sand, clay, loam)
dati.new <- data.frame(soil.type, yields)
dati.new
```

## Check for heteroschedasticity

```{r}
by(dati.new$yields, dati.new$soil.type, var)
fligner.test(yields ~ soil.type, data=dati.new)
```

There is no evidence of any significant difference in variance across the three samples, so it is legitimate to continue with the analysis.

## Continue with the analysis of variance

```{r}
anova.yields <- aov(yields ~ soil.type, data=dati.new)
summary(anova.yields)
```

```{r}
anova(lm(yields ~ soil.type, data=dati.new))
```

## Graphically check for the assumptions

```{r}
plot(anova.yields)
```

The first plot check the most important assumption of constancy of variance: there should be no pattern in the residuals against the fitted values, and, indeed, there is none.   
The second plot tests the assumption of normality of errors: there should be a straight-line relationship between our standardized residuals and theoretical quantiles derived from a normal distribution. Points 6, 11 and 13 lie a little off the straight line, but this is nothing to worry about.   
The third plot shows that the residuals are well behaved.   
The fourth plot shows that there are no highly influential values that might be distorting the parameter estimates. 

## Fit a linear model to the data to find out between which soil types the differences are actually significant

```{r}
mod <- lm(yields ~ soil.type, data=dati.new)
summary(mod)
```

```{r}
dati.relevel <- dati.new
dati.relevel$soil.type <- relevel(dati.relevel$soil.type, ref="sand")
mod.relevel <- lm(yields ~ soil.type, data=dati.relevel)
summary(mod.relevel)
```


```{r}
# Tukey Honestly Significant Differences
TukeyHSD(anova.yields) # where anova.yields comes from aov()
```
