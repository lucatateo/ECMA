# Regression with a qualitative and a quantitative explanatory variable

The *trees* data do not have any qualitative explanatory variables, so we will construct one
for illustrative purposes. We will replace the variable
*Height* by a new variable *Tall* which indicates whether or not the cherry tree is taller than a
certain threshold (the sample median height of 76 ft).   
In R, for this purpose we use the *cut* function:

```{r Tall}
trees$Tall <- cut(trees$Height, breaks = c(-Inf, 76, Inf),
                  labels = c("no", "yes"))
trees$Tall[1:5]
class(trees$Tall)
```

We perform MLR as we normally would:

```{r treesdummy, echo=FALSE}
treesdummy.lm <- lm(Volume ~ Girth + Tall, data = trees)
summary(treesdummy.lm)
```

(Note: R defines Tallyes automatically without input from the user)   

We conclude
that the mean response differs for trees with *Tall = yes* and trees with *Tall = no*.   

## Plot of the regression lines

We can see a plot of the two regression lines:

```{r treesdummy-plot}
# # we split the trees data into
# # two pieces, with groups determined by the Tall variable:
# treesTall <- split(trees, trees$Tall)
# # we add the Fitted values to each
# # piece via predict
# treesTall[["yes"]]$Fit <- predict(treesdummy.lm, treesTall[["yes"]])
# treesTall[["no"]]$Fit <- predict(treesdummy.lm, treesTall[["no"]])
# # we set up a plot for the variables Volume versus Girth
# # but we do not
# # plot anything yet (type = n) because we want to use different symbols for the two groups
# plot(Volume ~ Girth, data = trees, type = "n")
# # we add points to the plot for the Tall = yes trees and use an open circle for a plot character
# # (pch = 1), followed by points for the Tall = no trees with a triangle character (pch = 2).
# points(Volume ~ Girth, data = treesTall[["yes"]], pch = 1)
# points(Volume ~ Girth, data = treesTall[["no"]], pch = 2)
# # we add regression lines to the plot, one for each group
# lines(Fit ~ Girth, data = treesTall[["yes"]])
# lines(Fit ~ Girth, data = treesTall[["no"]])

plot(Volume ~ Girth, data = trees)
abline(a = -34, b = 4.69, col="red") # alberi bassi
abline(a = -30, b = 4.69, col="blue") # alberi alti

```


# Regression with just one qualitative variable (two levels: yes/no)

Using the above regression model, we concluded
that the mean response differs for trees with *Tall = yes* and trees with *Tall = no*.  
That is we assessed that the mean *Volume* of tall trees is actually different from the *Volume* of small trees.   
We now run a model including just the qualitative variable *Tall* - compare the results with those obtained with a simple *t*-test:

```{r treesttest}

treesdummy.lm <- lm(Volume ~ Tall, data = trees)
summary(treesdummy.lm)

head(trees)
tall.trees <- subset(trees, trees$Tall=="yes")
small.trees <- subset(trees, trees$Tall=="no")
t.test(tall.trees$Volume, small.trees$Volume)

```

Are the results consistent?

# Regression with just one qualitative variables (more levels)

(Example from Verzani - Simple R)
A school is trying to grade 24 different scholarship applications. The job is carried out by 3 graders. The scholarship committee would like to ensure that each grader is using the same
grading scale, as otherwise the students aren't being treated equally. One approach to checking if the graders are using the same scale is to randomly assign each grader 8 exams and have them grade. Then compare the grades for the 3 graders knowing that the differences should be due to chance errors if the graders all grade equally.

```{r graders}
scores.graderA = c(4,3,4,5,2,3,4,5)
scores.graderB = c(4,4,5,5,4,5,4,4)
scores.graderC = c(3,4,2,4,5,5,4,4)
scores <- c(scores.graderA,scores.graderB,scores.graderC)
graders <- c(rep("A",8), rep("B",8), rep("C",8))
scores.graders <- data.frame(graders,scores)
boxplot(scores ~ graders, data=scores.graders)
```

It appears that grader B is different from graders A and C. We test whether there's a difference or not with a regression analysis:

```{r graders-regression}

mod <- lm(scores ~ graders, data=scores.graders)
summary(mod)

```

```{r anova}

summary(aov(scores ~ graders, data=scores.graders))
# oppure
anova.prova <- aov(scores ~ graders, data=scores.graders)
summary(anova.prova)
                   

```


```{r}

anova(lm(scores ~ graders, data=scores.graders))

```


```{r}

oneway.test(scores ~ graders, data=scores.graders, var.equal=T) #Test whether two or more samples from normal distributions have the same means. The variances are not necessarily assumed to be equal.

```
